# Color Scheme

Theme Cupertino supports both light and dark mode, it's automatically controlled according to the browser's preferences.

```yaml filename="theme/hexo-theme-cupertino/_config.yml"
color_scheme: [light/dark/auto]
```

You can also provide a toggle button for readers to switch between light and dark mode.
