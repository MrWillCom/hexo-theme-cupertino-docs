# Hero Exit While Scrolling

Hero exit while scrolling hides the hero section when the visitor scrolls down.

This is enabled by default and will work in supported browsers. For those outdated ones, this feature won't make any effect.

In order to ensure the performance, `hero_exit_while_scrolling.blur_filter` is `false` by default. The following video showcases the blur filter:

If blur filter looks good to you, you can enable it by setting:

```yml filename="_config.cupertino.yml"
hero_exit_while_scrolling:
  blur_filter: true
```

If you don't want this feature, disable it:

```yml filename="_config.cupertino.yml"
hero_exit_while_scrolling:
  enabled: false
```
