# View Transition

View transition provides transition between page and page. This feature depends on view transition support of the browser, which is experimental and has limited availability.

View transition is enabled out-of-box. It will only work in supported browsers, avoiding unexpected outcomes in some outdated ones.

<video autoPlay loop muted>
  <source src="/videos/view-transition.mp4" type="video/webm" />
</video>

However, it is still okay to be disabled by setting:

```yml filename="_config.cupertino.yml"
view_transition: false
```
