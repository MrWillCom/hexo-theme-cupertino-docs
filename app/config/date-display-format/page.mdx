# Date Display Format

Theme Cupertino allows you to customize your own format to display date. Refer to [Moment.js | Docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/) to learn more about how to write your own. The default is as following:

```yml filename="_config.cupertino.yml"
date_display_format: MMMM D, YYYY
```
