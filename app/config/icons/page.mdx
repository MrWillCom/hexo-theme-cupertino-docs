# Icons

Theme Cupertino has built-in support for two icon packs â€” [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/). They are enabled by default. You need to head to their docs for usage.

However, if you really don't need them, they can be disabled by setting:

```yml filename="_config.cupertino.yml"
simple_icons: false
bootstrap_icons: false
```

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning">
  Theme Cupertino requires Bootstrap Icons to display some icons of the UI,
  don't turn it off unless you know what exactly you're doing.
</Callout>
