# Built-in Components

All components are enabled by default, but you can still disable some of them. All built-in components is listed as following:

```yml filename="_config.cupertino.yml"
builtin_components:
  card: true
  button: true
  badge: true
  utilities: true
  carousel: true
```

Set to `false` to disable specific components.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components'

<Callout type="warning">
  However, disabling some specific built-in components may break the styles of
  the theme. Keeping all components enabled is recommended.
