# Migrate from v1

<Steps>
## Update theme

Since v2, you have more methods to install Theme Cupertino, but the old method is still good to use. If you want to change to other methods, go to [Get Started](/get-started).

Then, you need to update your theme according to your installation method.

## Use `_config.cupertino.yml` instead of modifying the submodule

In v2, `_config.cupertino.yml` is preferred as it's a more straightforward method to customize your blog.

## Add `hero`

`title` and `subtitle` of your blog configuration is no longer used as the hero section of the home page. You need to add the following configuration:

```yml filename="_config.cupertino.yml"
hero:
  title: <blog-title>
  description: <blog-subtitle>
```

<br />

<Cards.Card
  icon={<LayoutPanelTop />}
  title="Hero Section"
  href="/config/hero"
  arrow
/>

## Migrate navigation and footer

<Cards num={2}>
  <Cards.Card icon={<PanelTop />} title="Navigation" href="/config/nav" arrow />
  <Cards.Card
    icon={<PanelBottom />}
    title="Footer"
    href="/config/footer"
    arrow
  />
</Cards>

## Migrate search

[hexo-generator-search](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-generator-search) is no longer used, you should migrate to [Pagefind](https://pagefind.app/).

<br />

<Cards.Card
  icon={<Search />}
  title="Set Up Search"
  href="/guides/set-up-search"
  arrow
/>

## Migrate from saved icons to icon packs

The icons for social media platforms are replaced with [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and other icons are now using [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

Especially in navigation, those auto icon transformations are deprecated. You should use something like `<i class="si si-github"></i>` from now on.

<br />

<Cards.Card icon={<Grid3x3 />} title="Icons" href="/config/icons" arrow />

## Move some modifications to `insertions`

If you used to modify the source code of Theme Cupertino to add custom `<style />`, `<link />` and so on, they have safer place to reside now.

<br />

<Cards.Card
  icon={<BetweenHorizontalEnd />}
  title="Insertions"
  href="/config/insertions"
  arrow
/>

## `og_enabled`, `og_image` and `og` are deprecated

Open Graph generation uses [Hexo's built-in helper `open_graph`](https://hexo.io/docs/helpers#open-graph).

Done! Build again to bring the latest features to life.

<Cards.Card
  icon={<Wrench />}
  title="Configuration"
  href="/config/overview"
  arrow
/>
