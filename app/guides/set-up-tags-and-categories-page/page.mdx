# Set Up Tags and Categories Page

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

Tags and categories features are enabled by default. But only part of them are available out-of-box. Tags and categories page cannot be generated without performing the following steps:

<Steps>
## Add two new pages

```sh npm2yarn
npm exec hexo new page 'tags'
npm exec hexo new page 'categories'
```

## Replace the page content

You should edit two new files at `source/tags/index.md` and `source/categories/index.md`. Replace all of their content with the following:

```markdown filename="source/tags/index.md"
---
type: tags
---
```

```markdown filename="source/categories/index.md"
---
type: categories
---
```

</Steps>
